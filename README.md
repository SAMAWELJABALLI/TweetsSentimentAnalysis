# Tweets Sentiment Analysis

This project is based on the dataset available at https://www.kaggle.com/c/tweet-sentiment-extraction/overview which is composed of about 20k tweets to train sentiment predictors.

The "TweetsSentimentPredictions.ipynb" notebook will guide you through the process of tweets cleaning (a very basic NLP task when dealing with text data), training a few Deep Learning models with different architectures and finally inferencing on test text. In the other hand, the "ModelDeployment.ipynb" notebook will guide you through the process of deploying the selected model in AWS SageMaker.
